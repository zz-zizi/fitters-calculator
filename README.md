## Things I have noticed

- voice recognition is not working in brave browser
  -transcript has different output formats depending on if the fraction is said in the voice command

## Not yet implemented

- ALOT has not been implemented this is just the beginning.. for now it is easier to explain what IS working and that is the feet and inches numpad, fraction buttons, and the voice command input, All of these are updating state and displaying the correct output.
